This work is committed to the Public Domain.

If you'd like a license even though you don't need one, send me email.  In some jurisdictions, this may be required.  My intent is to mirror SQLite's approach.

Though entirely optional, I would appreciate hearing from anyone who uses this code in their project!

My email address is adam@adamsmith.cc.

Thanks!
